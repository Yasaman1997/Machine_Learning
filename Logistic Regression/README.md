**Introduction**
Logistic Regression is a Machine Learning classification algorithm that is used to predict the probability of a categorical dependent variable. In logistic regression, the dependent variable is a binary variable that contains data coded as 1 (yes, success, etc.) or 0 (no, failure, etc.). In other words, the logistic regression model predicts P(Y=1) as a function of X.

**Logistic Regression Assumptions**
Binary logistic regression requires the dependent variable to be binary.
For a binary regression, the factor level 1 of the dependent variable should represent the desired outcome.
Only the meaningful variables should be included.
The independent variables should be independent of each other. That is, the model should have little or no multicollinearity.
The independent variables are linearly related to the log odds.
Logistic regression requires quite large sample sizes.
Keeping the above assumptions in mind, letâ€™s look at our dataset.

**Data**
The dataset comes from the UCI Machine Learning repository, and it is related to direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict whether the client will subscribe (1/0) to a term deposit (variable y). The dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/madmashup/targeted-marketing-predictive-engine/master/banking.csv)
